        <h2>The Mexican Casserole Recipe</h2>
            <p>The first version of a Mexican casserole seems to have been 
              the muk-bil (literally, “to put in the ground”). Made by the 
              Mayans on the Yucatan Peninsula since pre-Hispanic times, it 
              is the King Kong of tamales.</p>
            <p>A Mexican casserole does not refer to a specific recipe per se,
              but is a broad term that describes a type of hot dish containing
              Mexican-style ingredients and flavorings. Ingredients are typically
              layered or mixed together and baked in an oven. A typical Mexican
              casserole may contain some combination of seasoned meat, black beans,
              or refried beans and cheese, like cheddar or Monterey jack. Rice,
              tortillas, or both are frequently used in between layers. Frequently,
              they contain vegetables like corn and may be topped with lettuce,
              sour cream, or salsa. The variations on Mexican casserole are 
              virtually endless.</p>
