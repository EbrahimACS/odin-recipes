        <h2>The Spagetti with Tomato Sauce Recipe</h2>
           <p>The use of tomato sauce with pasta appeared for the first time in 
            1790 in the Italian cookbook L'Apicio moderno, by Roman chef 
            Francesco Leonardi.</p>
           <p>Tomato sauce (also known as Neapolitan sauce, salsa roja in Spanish,
             or salsa di pomodoro in Italian) can refer to many different sauces
             made primarily from tomatoes, usually to be served as part of a dish,
            rather than as a condiment. Tomato sauces are common for meat and 
            vegetables, but they are perhaps best known as bases for Mexican salsas
            or sauces for pasta dishes. Tomatoes have a rich flavor, high water 
            ontent, soft flesh which breaks down easily, and the right composition
            to thicken into a sauce when they are cooked (without the need of 
            thickeners such as roux). All of these qualities make them ideal 
            for simple and appealing sauces.</p>
        
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>¼ cup olive oil </li>
                    <li>1 onion, chopped </li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder </li>
                    <li>4 pounds fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped </li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar </li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon dried basil </li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon dried parsley </li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                         Add onion and garlic powder; cook and stir until onion is 
                         translucent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, sugar, basil, parsley, 
                         and salt. Bring to a boil.</li>

                       <li>Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens,
                         1 to 2 hours.</li>
                    </ol>
